        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p1>Hello, my name is Sofia. I was born on May 4<sup>th</sup> 2007 and am currently 18 years old. I was born in Mexico however I am a Canadian citizen as I have lived in Ottawa for almost 18 years. I live with both my parents, my younger sister, and my pet dog and my pet guinea pig.</p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p2>I am currently enrolled in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at algonquin collage. I would consider myself someone who is hardworking with many interests, some of which include photography, music, and dance. Iâ€™m really looking forward to exploring all of the aspects of this program including the technology side along with the design components. I think education is very important but I also believe that <em>drive and passion</em> is essential for success.</p2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p3>Here is a quote that I like that showcases the importance of passion: </p3>
        <blockquote>"Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you" --<cite>Oprah Winfrey</cite></blockquote>
